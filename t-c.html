      Welcome to the Team Ninja Craft community
Hangout, have fun, chat, make friends, and enjoy minecraft with others, because minecraft is better together.
Like in all Ninja Training we do expect that you follow the Ninja Code to ensure everyone has a great experience here.

  Abide by Discord's "Terms of Service and Community Guidelines": you must be 13 years or older to use Discord.
----------- Here is a link to such https://discordapp.com/guidelines

  Respect: be cool, be civil; it's okay to have different opinions but respect everyone's right to have theirs as well.

  No Hate: no racism, sexism, anti-LGBQT, or otherwise offensive content. There is zero tolerance for hate speech, and will result in a permanent ban!

  Use appropriate channels:
.                  dojo-hangout - general chat
.                  shared-minecraft - minecraft builds and redstone
.                  mc-promo - minecraft videos/minecraft community member live streams
.                  meme_central - memes (no XP gained)

  Do not use "@here" or "@everyone". Just don't do it.

  No advertising other sites or discord servers.

  Any questions, or problems ask an Admin or Moderator, we have a great team always willing to help.

Thank you for supporting Team Ninja Craft and have fun earning your belts in the Dojo. (edited)
